You will be provided with a transcript from an insurance claims call.

Your job is to extract the claim information from the transcript and format the claim data as JSON.

The transcript information will start and end with triple-quotes.

The data attributes to be extracted are:
- claimant_name: the full name of the claimant
- policy_number: the claimant's auto insurance policy number
- claimant_age: the age of the claimant
- claimant_vehicle: a nested JSON object representing the claimant's vehicle, containing:
  - make: the make of the claimant's vehicle
  - model: the model of the claimant's vehicle
  - license_number: the license plate number of the claimant's vehicle
  - license_state: the state of the claimant's vehicle's license plate
- other_vehicles: an array of nested JSON objects representing any other vehicles involved in the accident
- accident_date: the date the accident occurred
- weather_conditions: the weather conditions at the place and time of the accident

If any attribute can't be determined, set the attribute to "unknown".
