Hello customer surport,

I have some feedback on your product that I'd like to share. I bought a sweater from your company last week. It looks nice and I like the colors, but the fit is terrible. Also it's very itchy, and smells bad. I'd like to know how to return it for a refund. Can you help me get my money back?

I liked the pants I bought last month, but now I'm an unhappy costumer.

Please help!
